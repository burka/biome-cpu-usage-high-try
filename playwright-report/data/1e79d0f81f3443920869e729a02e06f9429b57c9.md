  - paragraph: Before version 2.0, Biome lint rules could only operate on one file at a time. This brought us far, but many of the more interesting rules require information from other files too.

  - paragraph: After several months of hard work, we are pleased to announce that the HTML formatter is now ready for users to try out and report bugs! This is a huge step towards Biome fully supporting HTML-ish templating languages used in frameworks such as Vue and Svelte.
  - paragraph:
    - text: For now, the HTML formatter only touches actual
    - code: .html
    - text: files, so it doesn‚Äôt format HTML in
    - code: .vue
    - text: or
    - code: .svelte
    - text: files yet. It also won‚Äôt format embedded languages like JavaScript or CSS yet. HTML‚Äôs options like
    - code: attributePosition
    - text: ","
    - code: bracketSameLine
    - text: ", and"
    - code: whitespaceSensitivity
    - text: have been implemented.
  - paragraph:
    - text: The HTML formatter is still in the experimental stage, so it will remain
    - strong: disabled by default for the full 2.0 release
    - text: . At the time of writing, Biome can parse most of the Prettier‚Äôs HTML test suite, and format 46/124 of them correctly. Despite not matching Prettier yet, we‚Äôre pretty confident that it
